    "Python code defines a function find_rectangles(matrix) that finds all rectangles of zeros in a given 2D matrix. The rectangles are defined by their top-left and bottom-right corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the matrix. It starts by initializing a visited matrix of the same size as the input matrix, filled with False values, and an empty list rectangles to store the rectangles found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dfs(i, j) function is a helper function that performs the DFS. It takes a cell (i, j) as input. If the cell is out of bounds, already visited, or contains a 1, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it marks the cell as visited, updates the bottom-right corner of the current rectangle (stored in rectangles[-1][1]), and recursively calls dfs on the right and bottom neighbors of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main part of find_rectangles iterates over each cell in the matrix. If a cell contains a 0 and has not been visited, it starts a new rectangle with the top-left and bottom-right corners both set to the current cell, and calls dfs on the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a rectangle and contains the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then tests the function on a sample matrix and prints the result. The output is a list of rectangles, where each rectangle is represented by a tuple of two tuples: the first tuple is the coordinates of the top-left corner, and the second tuple is the coordinates of the bottom-right corner.\n",
